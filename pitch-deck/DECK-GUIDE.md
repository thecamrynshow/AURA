## Slide-by-Slide Content

### Slide 1: Title
- Logo animation (breath rings)
- **PNEUOMA**
- "Nervous System Regulation Infrastructure for Schools"
- "Camryn Jackson · Founder"
- "Built by a school leader. Designed for real classrooms."
- pneuoma.com · 2026

### Slide 2: The Problem
- **"Schools are facing a regulation crisis."**
- "Dysregulation → escalation → burnout → lost learning."
- Insight: "Existing tools are reactive, fragmented, or optional."

### Slide 3: Why Current Solutions Fail
- **"Why current approaches fail"**
- SEL = curriculum, not infrastructure
- Behavior systems = symptom management after escalation
- Wellness programs = add-ons, not embedded into the school day
- Anchor: "Schools lack proactive nervous-system infrastructure."

### Slide 4: The Insight
- **"Regulation must be built in, not added on."**
- "The nervous system is foundational to: Learning, Safety, Behavior, Retention"
- "Without regulation, every other intervention leaks."

### Slide 5: The Solution
- **"Regulation through play, ritual, and breath."**
- Designed for real school constraints: lightweight · implementable · repeatable
- Pillars:
  - 🎮 Play
  - 🔁 Ritual
  - 🌬️ Breath

### Slide 6: What the Product Does
- Biofeedback-powered games
- Daily regulation rituals
- Tools for students + educators
- Outcome line: "Designed to reduce escalation, recovery time, and educator burnout while increasing time-on-task."
- Note: Initial deployment: K-12 school environments

### Slide 7: Traction / Validation
- Traction
- 9+ years practitioner-led development
- Live platform built and operational
- 2026 school pilots launching
- Current stage: Pilot validation
- Optional: "Built from lived experience inside K-12 systems."

### Slide 8: Market Focus
- Built for the intersection of education, health, and gaming
- Initial focus: U.S. K-12 schools
- Expansion pathways validated through institutional adoption

### Slide 9: Business Model
- School-first licensing
- Primary: B2B schools (low four figures per school, annual institutional licensing, includes student + educator tools)
- Future pathways (post-validation): healthcare, families
- Pricing refined through pilots → conversion

### Slide 10: Roadmap
- 2026: Pilot validation, outcome measurement, deployment refinement
- 2027: First paid school partners, pilot → paid conversion, repeatable onboarding playbook
- 2028: Scalable deployment model, district-level expansion

### Slide 11: Founder
- Camryn Jackson, Founder
- Former school leader (Dean / Athletic Director)
- Built from lived experience in high-needs school environments
- University of Michigan alumnus
- Founder-led insight + execution

### Slide 12: Why Desai
- "Desai is the right partner for this stage."
- Support during pilot → paid conversion
- Mentorship from operators who understand scaling responsibly
- Refinement of deployment, pricing, and institutional adoption
- Execution support from validation to repeatable revenue
- Goal: "Build regulation infrastructure that schools can actually sustain."

## Design Tips

1. **Dark backgrounds** throughout — matches brand
2. **Accent color for numbers** — draws attention to stats
3. **Generous whitespace** — let content breathe
4. **Subtle animations** — fade in, not flashy
5. **Consistent card style** — rounded corners (16px), subtle background

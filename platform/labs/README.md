# PNEUOMA Labs

> *Exploring the frontiers of sound, light, and healing*

## Overview

PNEUOMA Labs is a research platform for simulating and experimenting with acoustic, optical, and vibrational phenomena. These modules explore the deep connections between frequency and form—how vibration creates light, and how light can heal.

## Research Modules

### 🌊 Resonance Lab (Featured)

## The Science

### Waveform Harmonics
| Waveform | Harmonics | Character |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Sine | Fundamental only | Pure, mathematical |
| Square | Odd (1, 3, 5, 7...) | Harsh, hollow |
| Triangle | Odd (falls off 1/n²) | Soft, mellow |
| Sawtooth | All (1, 2, 3, 4...) | Rich, brassy |

### Spherical Harmonics
The 3D patterns are spherical harmonics Y_l^m—the same mathematics describing:
- Electron orbitals in atoms
- Gravitational fields of planets
- Cosmic microwave background fluctuations

### Sonoluminescence
When acoustic waves drive bubbles to collapse, compression reaches ~15,000K—hotter than the sun's surface—causing light emission from pure sound.

### Healing Frequencies
| Frequency | Name | Application |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| 7.83 Hz | Schumann Resonance | Earth's electromagnetic heartbeat |
| 40 Hz | Gamma Waves | Cognitive enhancement, memory |
| 174 Hz | Solfeggio | Pain relief, security |
| 528 Hz | DNA Repair | Transformation |
| 630-700 nm | Red Light | Skin healing, collagen |
| 810-850 nm | Near-Infrared | Deep tissue penetration |

## Technology

- **Frontend**: HTML5 Canvas, Three.js, WebGL
- **Visualization**: Real-time 2D/3D rendering
- **Physics**: Numerical simulation of wave equations
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for sound synthesis

## Vision

> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
> — John 1:1

Across traditions and sciences, vibration and frequency emerge as fundamental to creation. These labs are a step toward understanding these deep connections.

## Email Template 1: Cold Outreach to School Counselor

**Subject:** Free SEL Breathing Games for Your Students - Pilot Program

---

Dear [Counselor Name],

I'm reaching out because I've built something I think could genuinely help your students—and I'd love your feedback.

**PNEUOMA** is a platform of breath-controlled games designed to help kids regulate their nervous systems. Think "video games, but instead of controllers, students use their breath."

Here's what makes it different:
- **No download required** - works instantly in any browser
- **Classroom Sync** - you can guide your entire class through a breathing exercise together
- **Research-backed** - based on polyvagal theory and nervous system regulation
- **Kid-approved** - they think they're playing a game; you know they're learning to self-regulate

**I'm offering free pilot access to 3 schools this semester.**

What I'm asking for in return:
- 20-30 students using the platform over 4-6 weeks
- Brief pre/post surveys (I'll provide these)
- 15 minutes of your feedback at the end

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this might be a fit for your students?

Here's a quick demo video: [LINK]

Warm regards,

## Email Template 2: Follow-Up (3 days later)

**Subject:** Quick follow-up on breathing games for students

---

Hi [Name],

Just wanted to follow up on my email about PNEUOMA—our breath-controlled games for student regulation.

I know counselors are incredibly busy, so I'll keep this brief:

**One teacher told me:** "The kids who struggle most with transitions are the ones who took to this the fastest."

If you have 15 minutes this week or next, I'd love to show you how it works. You can also explore on your own at pneuoma.com/games.

No pressure either way—I know you're juggling a lot.

Best,
Camryn

## Email Template 3: Principal/Administrator

**Subject:** SEL Technology Pilot - Free for [School Name]

---

Dear [Principal Name],

I'm writing to introduce a new tool that's helping schools address student dysregulation—one of the biggest challenges facing classrooms today.

**PNEUOMA** is a browser-based platform of biofeedback games that teach students to self-regulate through breath and mindfulness. Unlike typical "calm down" apps, our games use breath as the controller—so students are actively engaged rather than passively watching.

**Why schools are excited about this:**

1. **Reduces transition time disruptions** - Teachers report students settle faster after using our games
2. **Classroom Sync technology** - Unique feature that synchronizes breathing across an entire classroom
3. **No IT burden** - Browser-based, no downloads, works on existing devices
4. **Aligned with SEL standards** - Supports CASEL competencies

**We're offering free pilot programs to 3 schools this semester.**

I'd welcome the opportunity to present this to you or your counseling team. Could we schedule a 20-minute demo?

Best regards,
Camryn Jackson

## Phone Script

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is Camryn Jackson. I sent you an email about PNEUOMA—we make breathing games for students. Do you have a quick minute?"

**If yes:**
"Great! In a nutshell, we've built games where kids use their breath as the controller. So they're playing, but they're actually learning to regulate their nervous system. I'm looking for 3 schools to pilot this semester—completely free—and I thought [School Name] might be a good fit based on your SEL focus. Would you be open to a 15-minute demo to see if it might work for your students?"

**Common objections:**

*"We already have SEL curriculum."*
"Totally understand—this isn't meant to replace your curriculum, but to supplement it. Think of it as a tool students can use independently when they're dysregulated. What do you currently do when a student needs to calm down?"

*"We don't have time."*
"I hear you—that's exactly why this is browser-based with no setup. Students can access it independently. Teachers tell me it actually saves time because students self-regulate faster."

*"I need to talk to my principal."*
"Of course! Would it help if I sent you a one-page summary you could share with them? Or I'm happy to do a quick demo for both of you together."

## Sample Application: NIH NIMH SBIR Phase I

### Specific Aims (1 page)

**Title:** PNEUOMA: A Biofeedback Gaming Platform for Pediatric Anxiety Regulation

**Background:**
Anxiety disorders affect 1 in 5 children, yet access to evidence-based treatment remains limited. Digital therapeutics offer a scalable solution, but existing apps rely on passive consumption (videos, guided audio) rather than active engagement. This passive approach limits efficacy, particularly for children who struggle with attention and engagement.

**Innovation:**
PNEUOMA is a browser-based platform of biofeedback games that use breath, voice, and touch as controllers. By gamifying nervous system regulation, we transform therapeutic practice into engaging play. Our unique Classroom Sync technology enables group-based interventions, increasing accessibility in school settings.

**Specific Aims:**

**Aim 1:** Develop and refine a clinical version of PNEUOMA with enhanced outcome tracking and therapist dashboard.
- Integrate standardized anxiety measures (GAD-7, SCARED)
- Build therapist-facing dashboard for monitoring patient progress
- Implement session logging and compliance tracking

**Aim 2:** Conduct a feasibility study with 40 children aged 8-14 with mild-to-moderate anxiety.
- Randomized design: PNEUOMA vs. waitlist control
- Primary outcome: Change in SCARED scores at 6 weeks
- Secondary outcomes: Engagement metrics, user satisfaction, adverse events

**Aim 3:** Assess implementation feasibility in school counseling settings.
- Partner with 3 schools for real-world deployment
- Evaluate counselor adoption and student engagement
- Gather data to inform Phase II effectiveness trial

**Expected Outcomes:**
This Phase I study will establish the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of PNEUOMA as a digital therapeutic for pediatric anxiety. Positive results will support a Phase II randomized controlled trial comparing PNEUOMA to standard care.

### Research Strategy

#### A. Significance

**Burden of Disease:**
- 7.1% of children aged 3-17 have diagnosed anxiety (CDC, 2022)
- Untreated childhood anxiety leads to depression, substance abuse, and academic failure
- Average wait time for child mental health services: 6+ months in many regions

**Limitations of Current Approaches:**
- Traditional therapy: Limited accessibility, high cost, workforce shortage
- Existing apps (Calm Kids, Headspace for Kids): Passive consumption, low engagement
- Biofeedback devices (Mightier): Require hardware purchase, limit scalability

**PNEUOMA's Contribution:**
- Active engagement through gamification
- No hardware required (browser-based)
- Group delivery capability (Classroom Sync)
- AI companion support for between-session practice

#### B. Innovation

**Technical Innovation:**
1. **Browser-Based Biofeedback:** No download or hardware required. Uses device microphone for breath detection, enabling immediate, universal access.

2. **Multi-User Synchronization:** Proprietary technology synchronizes breathing exercises across multiple users in real-time. No existing platform offers this capability.

3. **AI Therapeutic Companions:** Four specialized AI companions provide personalized support for specific populations (anxiety, PTSD, addiction, trauma).

4. **Research Analytics:** Built-in session logging, engagement tracking, and outcome measurement enable rigorous evaluation.

**Conceptual Innovation:**
- Reframes nervous system regulation as play rather than treatment
- Leverages the engagement mechanics of gaming for therapeutic benefit
- Enables group-based interventions at scale (classrooms, therapy groups)

#### C. Approach

**Phase I Timeline: 12 Months**

**Months 1-3: Development & IRB**
- Enhance platform with clinical features
- Develop therapist dashboard
- Submit IRB protocol
- Recruit school partners

**Months 4-9: Feasibility Study**
- Recruit 40 participants (20 PNEUOMA, 20 waitlist)
- 6-week intervention period
- Bi-weekly check-ins
- Collect outcome data

**Months 10-12: Analysis & Reporting**
- Analyze primary and secondary outcomes
- Conduct qualitative interviews
- Prepare Phase II application
- Disseminate findings

**Study Design:**
- Design: Randomized, waitlist-controlled
- Population: Children 8-14 with SCARED scores ≥25
- Intervention: 15 minutes of PNEUOMA use, 3x/week for 6 weeks
- Control: Waitlist (receive access after study completion)

**Measures:**
- SCARED (primary outcome)
- User engagement (sessions, duration, games played)
- Satisfaction surveys (children and parents)
- Adverse event monitoring

**Analysis:**
- Intent-to-treat analysis
- Between-group comparison of SCARED change scores
- Engagement predictors of outcome

**Preliminary Data:**
